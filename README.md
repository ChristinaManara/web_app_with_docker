# web_app_with_docker
The aim of the project is to present a web application in Docker. First of all, there have been used tree basic services in order to achieve our goal. More specifically, Apache Server, MySQL and Docker have been used. Our system gives the opportunity to connect to server, you can log in from your broswer and as a user you can manage(add, delete, edit) other users who they do not have the permissions to do anything. In this case, you are a teacher so you manage your students

1.Run Docker
2.Open a broswer in localhost
Enjoy!
